        Hello, This is a TEST page to check the proper implimentation of GIT Repository.

        Let's check the following commands of GIT here.
        
        It is a good idea to get in the habit of always pulling your repository after you have done a commit but before you do a push. This pattern of add, commit, pull, push will allow you to do the following:

<span class="subtitle">Add:</span> Start tracking new files and changes when you finish the code you are working on.
<br>
<span class="subtitle">Commit:</span> Create a save point for your changes in the repository.
<br>
<span class="subtitle">Pull:</span> Retrieve other code changes from the remote repository AND merge those changes with your own. This is important because if there are any conflicts between the code you have written and committed and the code that you have pulled from the remote repository, you will need to fix it before you send it to the remote server.
<br>
<span class="subtitle">Push:</span> Send the committed code to the remote server.
